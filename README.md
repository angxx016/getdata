This file is a brief summary of my Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

run_analysis.R is the R script that cleans and produces tidy data set as required.
tidydata.txt is the output data file that required in the section 5 from instruction.
CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, or any work that I performed to clean up the data.
